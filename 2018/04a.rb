##
# I didn't read the input to notice it was not in-order despite the
# instructions hinting that it was unordered ("which have already been
# organized into chronological order") and lost a few minutes to that.  It
# manifested first as +guard_id+ being nil then as +sleep_start+ being nil.  I
# finally noticed the timestamps after noting my input has guards repeatedly
# waking up.
#
# The <code>sort_by { |timestamp,| timestamp }</code> isn't necessary, but I
# was worried about actions getting out-of-order if there were two timestamps
# for the same minute.  Reading the actions now, it is unnecessary because
# "G" from "Guard #" > "f" from "falls asleep" > "w" from "wakes up" thus order
# will be preserved for identical timestamps.
#
# I tried a few strategies for accounting by minute like the schedule uses
# instead of second (which Time uses internally).  First I created minute
# timestamps at parse-time but switched to calculating minutes timestamps
# inside the "wakes up" case after adding the +sleep_schedule+ Hash.  This
# allowed me to use Time#min to mark how many times a guard was asleep that
# minute in +sleep_schedule+.
#
# Initially I thought I needed to account for "guards count as asleep on the
# minute they fall asleep [â€¦] awake on the minute they wake up" by subtracting
# one minute, but this wasn't necessary.
#
# I think, because the timestamps are before the +time_t+ epoch Time uses,
# that I had to reverse the start and end timestamps for calculating the
# minutes asleep.  My math + logic is currently spent.
#
# I misspelled "guard" as "gaurd" so, so, so many times.
