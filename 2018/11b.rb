##
# I implemented #each_square better with in #each_square_of_size so it
# automatically trims the square to the correct dimensions.
#
# Originally #each_square_of_size was an O(NÂ³) implementation that would yield
# the dimension of the square and the coordinates of the entries in it.  I
# switched the implementation to one that better-resembles part A after
# reading a hint that implied I should print the state of my calculation by
# dimension.
#
# The maximum size trends up then back down so I was able to use a local
# maximum as a (correct) guess at the answer.
#
# Before doing that I tried several optimizations to reduce the calculating
# required including calculating row sums for a dimension to cache work in
# advance.  This was promising, but printing work-in-progress was better.
#
# Reading other hints, taking time to analyze intermediate products should
# help me come up with better solutions.  I likely would have seen a large
# field of negative values and would have guessed that larger dimensions would
# be unlikely to be maximums.
